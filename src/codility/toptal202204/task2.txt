You are given an array A of N integers and an integer S. Your task is to compute how many ways one can
choose a contiguous fragment of A that has an arithmetic mean equal to S. The arithmetic mean (average)
of a fragment is the sum of the elements of the fragment divided by its length. For example,
the arithmetic mean of [1, 4, 4, 5] is 14/4 = 3.5.

Write a function:

which returns the number of contiguous fragments of A whose arithmetic means are equal to S.
Write result is greater than 1,000.000,000, your function should return 1,000,000,000.

Examples:

1. Given A = [2, 1, 3] and S = 2, your function should return 3, since the arithmetic means of
fragments [2], [1, 3] and [2, 1, 3] are equal to 2.

2. Given A = [0, 4, 3, -1] and S = 2, your function should return 2, since fragments [0, 4] and [4, 3, -1]
have an arithmetic mean equal to 2.

3. Given A = [2, 1, 4] and S = 3, your function should return 0, since there exist no contiguous
fragments whose arithmetic mean is equal to 3.


Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
• N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
• S is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000]
• each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].
